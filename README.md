# Finespresso Modelling - Financial News Impact Prediction

A machine learning system that predicts the impact of financial news on stock prices using natural language processing and machine learning techniques.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This system analyzes financial news articles and predicts:
1. **Direction Classification**: Whether a stock will go UP or DOWN after news release
2. **Price Movement Regression**: The percentage change in stock price

The models are trained on real financial news data with corresponding price movements, covering various event types like earnings releases, clinical studies, mergers & acquisitions, and more.


## 🖼️ Case Study

Below is an example of a large (about 100%) overnight price move as a result of a press release and our system prediction:

- **Average Accuracy**: ~62% across all events
- **Best Performing Events**: 
  - Partnerships: 90.9% accuracy
  - Annual General Meeting: 87.5% accuracy
  - Corporate Action: 70% accuracy

### Regression Models

# Train regression models
python tasks/ai/train_regression.py
```

### 4. View Results
- **Model Performance**: `reports/model_results_binary.csv` and `reports/model_results_regression.csv`
- **Trained Models**: `models/` directory
- **Raw Data**: `data/` directory

## 📈 Model Training Process

### Current Approach
1. **Data Loading**: Load merged news and price data from CSV
2. **Text Processing**: 
   - Priority: `content_en` → `title_en` → `content` → `title`
   - spaCy preprocessing (lemmatization, stop word removal)
3. **Feature Extraction**: TF-IDF vectorization (1000 features max)
4. **Model Training**: 
   - Individual models per event (min 10 samples)
   - All-events fallback model
5. **Evaluation**: 80/20 train-test split with cross-validation metrics

### Current Limitations
- Basic text features only
- No market context features
- Simple TF-IDF vectorization
- Limited hyperparameter tuning
- No experiment tracking
