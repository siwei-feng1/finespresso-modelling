NEL ASA
 
				(October 16, 2024 - Oslo, Norway) Nel ASA (Nel, OSE: NEL) reported revenues of
NOK 366 million in the third quarter of 2024, up 21% from NOK 303 million in the
same quarter last year. EBITDA in the quarter was NOK -90 million (Q3 2023:
-62). The Alkaline segment contributed positively to Group EBITDA, but this was
more than offset by the negative contribution from the PEM segment due to
unusually low revenues in the quarter. Order intake was NOK 161 million (Q3
2023: 338 million). At the end of the quarter the order backlog was NOK 1 872
million, down 20% year-over-year. The cash balance was NOK 1 941 million at
quarter end.

Quarterly highlights

  · Revenue from continuing operations in the third quarter 2024 was NOK 366
million, up 21% from the third quarter 2023 (Q3 2023: 303). Revenue was
positively impacted by delivery of alkaline electrolyser equipment whereas
revenue from sale of PEM electrolyser equipment was low.

Reference is made to the stock exchange announcement made by CodeLab Capital AS
(the Company) on 26 June 2024 regarding the successful placing of a private
placement in the Company raising gross proceeds of NOK 40 million and a
potential subsequent offering of up to 17,241,379 new shares.

The shares in the Company have since 30 August 2024 traded below the
subscription price in the private
placement with volumes deemed substantial compared to the size of the potential
subsequent offering. Consequently, any shareholders wishing to reduce the
dilutive effect of the Private Placement have had the opportunity to purchase
shares in the Company in the market at prices similar to or below what would
have been the subscription price in the subsequent offering. The board of
directors of CodeLab has therefore
decided not to proceed with the subsequent offering.

Interim dividend of EUR 0.25 per A-share approved as part of EUR 450 million of cash returns in 2024, highlighting SES’s continued commitment to shareholder returns



The SES Board of Directors has approved the payment of an interim dividend of EUR 0.25 per A-share (EUR 0.1 per B-share) to be paid to shareholders on 17 October 2024, in line with the announcement made in February 2024 and SES’s commitment to shareholder returns.


The implementation of a semi-annual dividend distribution brings greater alignment between the cash generation of the business and cash returns to shareholders. The interim dividend to be paid next month will be followed, subject to shareholder approval, by the payment of a final dividend of at least EUR 0.25 per A-share (EUR 0.1 per B-share) in April 2025.
