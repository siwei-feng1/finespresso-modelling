Karolinska Development AB (Nasdaq Stockholm: KDEV) today announces an update from Organon on the development of the drug candidate OG-6219, acquired by Organon through its acquisition of Forendo Pharma in 2021. Following results from a Phase 2 clinical study with OG-6219, Organon plans to discontinue the clinical development of the drug candidate.

Bavarian Nordic was awarded the PRV in February 2025, following the approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration of the chikungunya vaccine, VIMKUNYA™ for prevention of disease caused by chikungunya virus in people 12 years of age and older. Pursuant to a license agreement assumed upon acquisition of the chikungunya vaccine in 2023, National Institutes of Health (NIH) will receive 20% of the gross proceeds from the sale of the PRV. The proceeds will be recognized as other operating income and thus will not impact the guided revenue expectations for 2025. However, EBITDA will be positively impacted and any impact on the guided EBITDA margin of 26-30% for 2025 will be updated upon closing of the transaction.

The EXIST study evaluates exidavnemab, a drug candidate being developed as a treatment for Parkinson’s disease and Multiple System Atrophy (MSA).  The first cohort in the ongoing clinical Phase 2a study EXIST evaluated a lower dose of exidavnemab compared to placebo in patients with Parkinson’s disease. An interim safety review showed that exidavnemab was safe and well tolerated. The positive outcome will result in the initiation of two further cohorts, to evaluate a higher dose of exidavnemab in comparison with placebo in patients with Parkinson’s disease as well as MSA.  “Exidavnemab is BioArctic’s second disease modifying treatment for severe brain diseases, building on a similar scientific approach as Leqembi®.
